# ChiffonJS
Open source dress-up game generator for artists (in early development)
# About
ChiffonJS is planned to be a web-based application built with React. Users will be able to visit the [ChiffonJS
webpage](https://chiffonjs.com) and create HTML/CSS/Javascript-based dress-up games using only a directory of images and CSS stylesheets, such as...

```
assets
|- base/
  |- 1.png
  |- 2.png...
|- face/
|- hair/
|- clothes/
|- background/
|- style.css 
```

Users will have the opportunity to download a blank <code>assets</code>directory with a basic style sheet and file structure. Users will be
able to upload a .zip file containing these assets and generate an HTML page which they can then host. Generated pages will be client-side
code only, so users will not have to worry about setting up complex servers. Ideally, users should be able to embed the resulting dress-up
game in their own websites using HTML elements such as <code><iframe></code>.
